# Andres Question
My question was which broad bean origin had the highest ratings. From my barplot, I found that Venezuela had the most highest ratings with 20 "4" ratings. When making this analysis I decided to just look at the top rated chocolates so I only looked at data entries that had a 4.0 rating.

```{r}
choco_filtered <- choco %>% filter(Rating==4)
head(choco_filtered)
ggplot(choco_filtered, aes(y = Broad.Bean.Origin)) + geom_bar()
```
