# Andres Question
My question was which broad bean origin had the highest ratings. From my barplot, I found that Venezuela had the most highest ratings with 20 "4" ratings. When making this analysis I decided to just look at the top rated chocolates so I only looked at data entries that had a 4.0 rating.

```{r}
origin = choco[c("Broad.Bean.Origin", "Rating")]
topO = origin[origin$Rating == 4,]

```

```{r}
barplot(table(topO$Broad.Bean.Origin), las=2, cex.names=0.55)
title(main="Top Places of Origin", xlab="", ylab="Count")
mtext(text = 'Country of Origin',side=1, line= 5.5)
```
```{r}
top_origin <- sum(topO == 'Venezuela')
top_origin
```
